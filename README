This directory contain a small project to build and run a C++ tool that can compute and preint statistics for each
column including count of items mean, standatrd deviation, min and max. The code was built using C++ 20 standard.

The program was built and tested using VS Code IDE on M1 Macbook Air. The following command was used to compile:
/usr/bin/g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -std=c++20 -g /Users/amitsharma/Documents/code/csv/csv_processor.cpp -o /Users/amitsharma/Documents/code/csv/csv_processor

If you need to compile on your machine make sure to change the path for g++ compiler, if needed.

To run the program please look at the usage below:
Usage: csv_processor csv_file_name [number_of_threads]
Where,
csv_file_name: (Requried) Name of the input csv whose stats will be printed (required)
number_threads : (Optional) Number of threads the user wants to spawn in multithreaded mode. Each column stats are computed in a separate thread. 
                If this argument is not given then the tool runs in a single thread(no multithreading is used). 

Here is a sample output:
