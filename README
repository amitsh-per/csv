This directory contain a small project to build and run a multi threaded C++ tool that can compute and print statistics for each of its
column including count of items, mean, standard deviation, min and max. The code was built using C++ 20 standard.

The program was built and tested using VS Code IDE on M1 Macbook Air. The following command was used to compile:
/usr/bin/g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -std=c++20 -g /Users/amitsharma/Documents/code/csv/csv_processor.cpp -o /Users/amitsharma/Documents/code/csv/csv_processor

If you need to compile on your machine, please make sure to change the path for g++ compiler, if needed.

To run the program, please look at the usage below:
Usage: csv_processor csv_file_name [number_of_worker_threads]
Where,
csv_file_name: (Requried) Name of the input csv whose stats will be printed (required)
number_of_worker_threads : (Optional) Number of worker threads that the user wants to spawn in multithreaded mode in addtion to the application's
                            main thread. Statistics for a batch of columns are computed in separate threads. If this argument is not given then the tool runs in a single thread(no multithreading is used). 

Here is a sample output:
